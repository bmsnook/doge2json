# doge2json
Utility script(s) to convert from dogeminer2 file formats to json (and possibly back)

This project is an excuse to better learn Python3 and how to deal with json files (or the dogeminer2 game is the excuse and this project is the medium).

Primarily a learning process, I'll add sometimes seemingly-superfluous comments to references of things I'm learning about in comments. Mostly, I intend this as a utility to ease examining dogeminer2 Save files from the command line (or prepare formatted JSON files to be viewed in IDEs) instead of having to copy/paste through web-based utilities.
